So Sheldon raises a big pull request, which receives a lot of comments from his fellow reviewers. He finds some comments are asking details where the reviewer tries to better understand his code, whereas, other comments are asking him making changes in the code. Now, he starts to read the review comments, he replies to some of them instantly. Others, he has to make changes to code and then reply(todos). For some of them he is not sure, so he wants to come back to them later (archive). Given his meticulous natures, he also wants to ensure that eventually he has addressed all the comments. All this should be possible for Sheldon, as well as for you!

```prcomments``` helps you address your pull request comments gracefully and turn them into a todo list.
